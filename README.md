# Tumultu_ 

Hello everyone! 
Tumutlu_ is my project that is secretly inspired by Gynvaels Coldwind "Ent". I wanted to do same thing but a little bit better with more functionality (and with some GUI, we all like GUI, right?).

### What is the purpose of this software?
Well, generally to help a little bit with file analysis. Or maybe when **_you_** are afraid, that this executable contains malicious software, cause it has *built-in* Virus Total integration (all you need is your own API key, but you can obtain it in just few seconds after you register on their website).

You can save all data you gathered, and it is splitted between 3 files. 2 logs and 1 image for sure.

Any feedback is welcome!
